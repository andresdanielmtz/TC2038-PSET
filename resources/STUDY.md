## Topics that I think I should study for this project

- Graph Theory
  - [x] Graph Coloring Problems
- Geometry
  - [x] Euclidean Distance
  - [x] Convex Hull
- Maximum Independent Set (MIS)
  - [x] Algorithms to solve MIS problems
- Graph Construction
  - [x] Build graph where towers are vertices and edges are the connections between towers
    - That's just adjacency matrix
  - [x] Connect vertices based on distance criteria
